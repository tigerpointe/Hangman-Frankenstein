.SYNOPSIS
Starts a game of Frankenstein's Monster (based on Hangman).

.DESCRIPTION
Players discover puzzle words or phrases by suggesting letters.
Each incorrect guess adds an element to the monster diagram.
The game ends when a solution is guessed, or a diagram is completed.

Various word and phrase dictionaries can be found online.

A dictionary can be a simple list of words or phrases, one per line.
For example:  frankenstein
              tic-tac-toe
              powershell programming

An optional category can be specified by adding a comma separator.
For example:  classic games, frankenstein
              classic games, tic-tac-toe
              computers, powershell programming

Please consider giving to cancer research.

.PARAMETER path
Specifies the path to a dictionary file of puzzle words and phrases.

.INPUTS
None.

.OUTPUTS
A whole lot of fun.

.EXAMPLE
.\Start-Frankenstein.ps1
Starts the program with the default options.

.EXAMPLE
.\Start-Frankenstein.ps1 -path ".\dictionary.txt"
Starts the program with a custom dictionary of puzzle words and phrases.
